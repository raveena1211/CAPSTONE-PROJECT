# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots üöóüìä MODEL-1 AND MODEL-2

## üìå Overview

This project implements a **dynamic pricing model for urban parking lots** using real-time traffic data, occupancy levels, and other contextual features. The goal is to optimize parking prices to balance demand, reduce congestion, and improve utilization using a streaming data pipeline.

Built as a part of **Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone** by the Consulting & Analytics Club √ó Pathway.

## Project Workflow
1.Load & Preprocess Data
Historical parking lot data loaded using pandas.
Converted to a simulated stream with timestamps.

2.Ingest Data in Pathway
Pathway reads stream.csv using pw.io.csv.read() in static mode.
Timestamp columns are merged for time-based logic.

3.Feature Engineering
Encoded traffic, vehicle type, and special-day indicators.
Derived normalized demand score based on capacity, queue, etc.

4.Dynamic Pricing Model
UDF calculates price based on demand, traffic, and vehicle type.
Output is clamped between ‚Çπ5 and ‚Çπ20.

5.Write Output
Final table with SystemCodeNumber, Timestamp, and calculatedPrice written to output.csv.

6.Visualize
Optional visualization using Python (e.g., Matplotlib or Bokeh) for trend plots and insights.
